# CLAUDE.md

Session-by-session history lives in [docs/devlog.md](docs/devlog.md). This file carries only the latest session, project intent, and conventions.

## Session 2026-08-30 late (laptop — PR #124 merged; #118 capture design WRITTEN and committed)

**PR #124 merged by Nico; main green on the merge commit `a917b278`.** Record flow, Discard
and the About tutorial are all on main. Three docs commits pushed this session: the handoff
(`82c81d42`), the #118 design (`eea2d4ff`), a second cloud-task prompt (`0234979b`).

**Design of record: `docs/plans/2026-08-30-118-capture-screen-design.md`** — every decision
owner-ratified at smoke. It supersedes the capture half of `2026-08-29-ux-redesign-design.md`.
Mockup, updated to match: https://claude.ai/code/artifact/d62b442d-7ecf-497b-b5c5-42b87ee0c391

**The load-bearing ruling: the record control NEVER moves, in any state.** An earlier draft
centred it in a 96 pt halo on the idle screen — a front-door idea that does not survive
capture no longer being the front door. Ready and Recording now differ only in the middle
band (empty vs. transcript) and in what the status row says. Owner's own words: *"why not
just keep it at the bottom?"*

Other ratified decisions: `.setup` becomes a thin ready state (journal header + backdate line
+ bar; two-voices, recovery banners, last entry and build stamp all leave); the two-voices
toggle is DELETED and the BN/LN switch goes live in every recording with a lazy frame-0
opener; the live transcript is New York serif with the hypothesis dimmed per-run; backdate
appears on BOTH ready and recording; **"Record another" is deleted** — it duplicated the
bar's own record button — and the receipt's entry becomes a tappable view/edit card
(*"Open isn't super clear here"*). **The record button stays WHITE with a black mic glyph** —
owner ruled 2026-08-30 (*"keep the mic as is, it's nice"*); the earlier "should it be red?"
question is closed, and the design's red is only the live dot and the Discard-free status row.

**Owner smoke, 5 steps — item 1 CLOSED as no-bug.** The "previous transcript text" was the
**Last entry card** doing its job, not a stale transcript region; `allEntries` excludes
trashed, so a discarded entry cannot appear there. The `8edb3db3` fix is sound. The card is
removed by the design anyway. Build stamp on the smoked app reads `built Aug 30, 9:24 AM PT`
(the 9:14 in the prior handoff was a directory mtime, not a build time — `dwarfdump --uuid`
remains the only identity worth quoting). Also learned: the sidebar has **All Entries**, not
"Library".

**Four things the code contradicted, each caught by checking rather than trusting:**
(1) `metadata.multiVoice` is a **synced, LWW-merged CloudKit field** with a per-field
`modified` stamp, read by `CaptureReceipt` — written at a different moment, never redefined.
(2) `BuildInfo.stamp` exists **only in `CaptureView`**; the 2026-08-29 doc's "moves to About"
never ran, and About shows the version *number*, a different fact. (3) Per-sentence transcript
emphasis is **unbuildable** — nothing tracks sentence boundaries; the real seam is
`TranscriptConsolidator`'s `committed` vs `provisional`, merged by frame position, so the
hypothesis is NOT reliably a trailing suffix. (4) The backdate audit trail Nico asked for
**already exists** — `EntryLogRecord` stores `from`/`to`/`cause` per field including
`originalDate`, and capture's writes go through the same chokepoint that produces that diff.

**Two cloud sessions were started at end of session** from `docs/cloud-tasks/`:
`73-74-dead-code.txt` (#73 + #74 dead code) and `118-prep-corrections.txt` (build stamp →
About, three stale doc comments). Both end at an OPEN PR — merges are Nico's.

**Next steps:**
1. **Review and merge the two cloud PRs** when they land. The #118-prep one has a known trap:
   adding a row to About pushes the diagnostic rows below the single `swipeUp()`
   `AboutUITests` relies on — a failure there is an under-scrolled test, not a broken feature.
2. **Write the #118 implementation plan** from the committed design, then SDD it. Deliberately
   NOT delegated: reviews on this project catch more defects in plans than in implementations,
   and §5's dimming spec is exactly the shape that ships an untestable assertion. It needs a
   proof-of-RED step and an adversarial reviewer.
3. **Measure before building §5.** Instrument `TranscriptConsolidator` and record a minute of
   real speech to see how long text stays provisional. If the window is short, the transcript's
   tail changes brightness continuously while reading aloud — motion in peripheral vision,
   the opposite of the screen's job. Needs real speech; the simulator won't produce it.
4. **Invite Lori**: when her Apple Account email arrives → ASC Users and Access → Customer
   Support role → TestFlight Internal group. Next TestFlight build should carry #119+#124.
5. **TestFlight build 13 is teed up but NOT uploaded.** `CFBundleVersion` bumped 12 → 13
   (`project.yml`); run `scripts/upload_testflight.sh ios` then `... macos`. Needs the Xcode
   GUI session awake (the archive leg cannot cloud-sign with an API key) and CI green on
   `82c81d42`, the only code commit since the last green. Carries #119 + #124 + the About
   rewrite.
6. **Parked** (unchanged): #122/#123 from the record-flow branch; #125 current-week times;
   #86 back-destination from an entry; NeutralCoverTile non-square overload;
   `EntryMonthGroup.id` salt; cache the month formatter; "Add Cover" pill routes to editor;
   sync hardening #91/#85; dark recovery-banner smoke.

## What Raconte is

Native SwiftUI universal app (iOS 26 + macOS 26) for private, single-user spoken-word
journaling. Full rebuild of the frozen web app at github.com/nicolovejoy/recountly
(recountly.org). **Audio is ground truth; the transcript is a derived, replaceable
interpretation** — that principle drives every design choice.

Plan of record: `docs/native-rebuild-plan.md` (architecture, milestones, migration,
web teardown). Detailed designs in `docs/plans/`:
- `2026-07-29-m1-capture-design.md` — Milestone 1: indestructible capture (segment
  format, state machine, recovery scan, task breakdown)
- `2026-07-29-data-model-and-migration.md` — GRDB schema, CloudKit mapping, export
  package spec, Neon migration
- `2026-07-29-apple-sdk-recon.md` — SDK availability verified against installed Xcode

Milestone 1 smoke doc: `docs/m1-paranoid-tests.md` (full iPhone pass + iPad and macOS
delta passes, 32 tests total).

## Identity

- App name: **Raconte** (French, "tell!" — English *recount* comes from *raconter*)
- Bundle id: `org.pianohouseproject.raconte` (CloudKit container later:
  `iCloud.org.pianohouseproject.raconte`). `pianohouseproject.org` is the owner's
  public-facing namespace for all his work — publisher, not product. Changed 2026-07-31
  from `org.recountly.raconte`, which was product-under-product; nothing had shipped.
- Repo: github.com/nicolovejoy/raconte
- Single user (the owner). No accounts, no server. iCloud identity only (Milestone 4).

## Stack

- SwiftUI multiplatform target (NOT Catalyst), Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- Capture: AVAudioSession (iOS) / AVAudioEngine tap, append-only PCM segments on disk.
- Transcription (M2): on-device SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber (iOS 26 API).
- Storage (M3): GRDB/SQLite + FTS5. Files in the app container.
- Sync (M4): CKSyncEngine → CloudKit private DB, custom zone.
- Xcode project is GENERATED — `project.yml` (XcodeGen) is the source of truth;
  `*.xcodeproj` is gitignored. After clone or project.yml edit: `xcodegen generate`.

## Commands

- `xcodegen generate` — (re)create Raconte.xcodeproj from project.yml

**Signing changed with M4 (2026-08-17) — the old bare macOS commands no longer work.**
The app now carries `com.apple.developer.icloud-*` entitlements, which are *restricted*:
macOS refuses to ad-hoc-sign a binary that has them (`"Raconte" has entitlements that
require signing with a development certificate`). Two macOS recipes, and it matters which:

Test (macOS) — ad-hoc signs against `Raconte-nocloud.entitlements`, the shipping list
minus the three sync keys. **Keeps the sandbox, which is not optional**: `RaconteTests`
runs with the real app as its test host, so an unsandboxed run makes `AppContainer.root()`
the owner's real `~/Library/Application Support/Raconte` rather than a container — the
launching app would scan and sweep his actual archive. Never `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
here. (`EntitlementsParityTests` pins the override against the generated file, so adding
a capability to project.yml and forgetting the override fails loudly.)

📋 **COPY THE BELOW**:

```
xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
  CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS=Raconte/Raconte-nocloud.entitlements test
```

Owner-smoke app build (macOS) — real automatic signing, so the app actually carries the
iCloud entitlement. **This is the only macOS build that can sync.** An app built with the
nocloud override launches and behaves normally but `SyncCoordinator.live()` returns nil
(it reads the signature's entitlement), so a sync smoke against it silently tests
nothing. Needs the iCloud capability enabled on the App ID.

📋 **COPY THE BELOW**:

```
xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/raconte-smoke -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

Hand the result over with `ditto`, never bare `cp -R`, and verify identity with
`dwarfdump --uuid` on `Raconte.debug.dylib` — see the DerivedData/stale-build traps above.

- iOS compile check: `xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build`
- iOS simulator: `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'` (check `xcrun simctl list devices` for available names). Simulator builds need **no** entitlements override — they don't validate restricted entitlements against a profile.
- UI tests (simulator only — macOS needs interactive automation permission):
  `xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme RaconteUI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' test`

## Working style

- Plan → implement → review via subagents, one milestone task at a time (task breakdown
  lives in the M1 design doc). Test-first for the pure core (state machine, recovery
  planner, segment math) — hardware behind protocols.
- Docs: plain and terse. No grandiose prose.
- Signing: team `8UK463WB83` (in project.yml) is a **paid** Apple
  Developer Program membership — the same team MusicForge ships under. Nothing is gated on
  enrollment: TestFlight, CloudKit containers, push and Live Activities are all available
  now. (Verified 2026-07-31 from the on-disk profiles: App Store distribution profiles and
  year-long expiries, neither of which a free personal team can produce.)
- **UI tests reach places through `openPlace(app, "sidebar.…")` in
  `RaconteUITests/UITestNavigation.swift`.** Never hard-code a navigation tap in a test
  class — `openPlace` already handles the iPhone-collapsed-vs-Mac/iPad-both-columns
  difference (back-button vs. straight tap) in one place.
- **Nothing that must happen while a capture is running may hang off a view's
  lifecycle.** `CaptureView` is no longer permanently mounted (nav redesign) — it can
  be navigated away from at any time. Anything that must keep working regardless
  (phase dispatch, the idle-timer hold, receipt reconciliation) lives on
  `CaptureScreenModel` itself, driven by the model's own observation of its state,
  never by `.onAppear`/`.onDisappear`/`.onChange` on a view.
- **`ContentView.swift` is rewritten by both `nav/split-view` and `m4/sync`** and the
  two will conflict on merge — expected and accepted (nav design §10); whichever
  branch merges second resolves the conflict by hand.
- **Never put an `Image` in a macOS `Menu` label.** On macOS a `Menu`'s label discards
  SwiftUI's sizing of a resizable `Image` and paints it at intrinsic size — a 768×1024
  cover photo laid out at 768×1024 *points*, covering the whole screen and pushing the
  rest of the label off-window (#69). Proven by a six-variant harness: no in-place
  clamp and no `.menuStyle` fixes it — the image has to leave the label entirely. A
  `Button` label is fine; the image only breaks inside a `Menu`.
- **A `JournalSpan`/date-range endpoint is a unit, not an instant.** `PartialDate` is
  `Comparable` by `anchorDate`, which fills absent components with the FIRST — "2001"
  anchors to 1 Jan 2001. A naive `start <= d && d <= end` comparison against raw
  `PartialDate`s therefore excludes most of the range it claims to cover. Expand each
  endpoint to its precision's unit before comparing: `start` to the earliest instant of
  its unit, `end` to an EXCLUSIVE upper bound (the first instant of the unit right after
  `end`'s), and test `date >= lowerBound && date < exclusiveUpperBound`. Subtracting a
  fixed second to fake an inclusive bound under-covers the final second of the unit —
  build the exclusive bound from `calendar.dateInterval(of:for:).end` untouched instead.
- **An offscreen `Form` `Section` FOOTER is absent from the accessibility tree until it is
  scrolled into view** — so a UI test asserting on an explanatory footnote below the fold
  finds nothing and fails for the wrong reason. Reveal it with a directional `swipeUp()`
  before querying (a directional scroll, not a fixed distance, so it survives other device
  sizes). Discovered 2026-08-21 on the journal editor's disabled-delete footnote.
- **The `RaconteUI` suite exceeds the Bash tool's HARD 10-minute cap** (600000 ms is the
  maximum the tool accepts), so a single whole-suite invocation is killed mid-run and reads
  exactly like a hang. Split it into two or more FOREGROUND `-only-testing:` invocations by
  test class and reconcile the counts against the baseline. Do **not** background it — a
  subagent never receives the completion notification, which is the single most common
  stall on this project (11 instances). The unit suite still fits inside the cap.
- **A `.sheet` attached to a `Form`'s `Section` silently never presents, on iOS 26** —
  observed, mechanism unconfirmed. Attach `.sheet`/`.fullScreenCover` to the screen's
  outer view (the `Form` itself, or above it), never to a `Section` or other child.
- **`.tap()` on a `Toggle` inside a `Form`/`List` hits the row's merged label+switch
  accessibility frame at its CENTRE, which for a full-width row is the label, not the
  switch — the tap silently never flips it.** Real finger taps work fine; this is an
  XCUITest-harness gap. Tap near the trailing edge instead, e.g.
  `coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: CGVector(dx: 0.92, dy: 0.5))` — re-tune the offset
  per row width if a wider layout (iPad) is ever covered.
- **A pushed screen that can be popped without warning must write through on commit,
  never hold a Done-button-shaped batch of unsaved edits.**
  `PlaceRouting.detailPath(afterSelecting:from:path:)` always returns `[]`, so any
  sidebar click (and on the Mac, ⌘1-4) pops the top of `detailPath` with zero chance for
  that screen to intervene. The pattern (`JournalEditorView`, matching `BackdateField`):
  commit each field twice, redundantly — on losing focus (the ordinary case), and again
  in `onDisappear` via an **unstructured `Task {}`, never `.task`** (SwiftUI cancels
  `.task` on disappear, defeating the whole point of the safety net).

**UI design rules (owner, 2026-08-02):**
- The capture screen pins a near-black background; any system control placed on it must
  pin `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` — ambient-scheme bubbles render dark-on-dark
  in light mode (bit us once).
- Prefer semantic colors over `Color(white:)` literals anywhere the background isn't
  pinned.
- Backdates are sticky: editable with explicit overrides, never clearable by one tap.
  Owner wants metadata edits auditable eventually (fold into T6 revision design).

## Shared conventions

<!-- These are Nico's cross-repo output rules. They're materialized into each repo's
CLAUDE.md so every agent (local, cloud, third-party) sees them as plain text. Source
of truth: prompt-lab/workflow/claude-md-shared.md — edit there and re-sync, never here. -->

- **Clickable URLs.** When pointing at any web destination (dashboard, repo, PR, deploy, settings, docs, localhost), print the full bare URL — `https://example.com` or `http://localhost:8080` — on its own, never just the page's name and never a markdown `[label](url)` link. Nico's terminal auto-linkifies raw `https://` text, so a bare URL is one-click and stays copyable.

- **Number your questions.** Any time you ask Nico more than one question, present them as a numbered list (1., 2., 3.) so he can answer by number with no ambiguity. A single standalone question needs no number.

- **Self-contained smoke-test instructions.** When you ask Nico to manually test or verify an app or website, assume zero carried-over context — he should never scroll back or recall a URL/path/credential from earlier. Always include: the exact URL (full `https://…` or `http://localhost:…`, restated even if mentioned above), the precise steps in order, and what a pass vs. fail looks like. Repetition here is a feature, not clutter.

- **UTC at rest, Pacific on display.** Timestamps are stored in UTC, always. A *calendar day* shown to a human is `America/Los_Angeles` — Nico's day, and the clock the work actually happened on. The two rules that follow are the ones that get broken: never form a date bucket with `new Date(…).toISOString().slice(0,10)` (that is UTC, so every chart axis and "today" silently rolls over at 5pm Pacific — it put a phantom tomorrow bar on the Prompt Lab dashboard), and never bucket UTC-stamped rows with a bare `date(col)` in SQL. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA', { timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles' })` in JS and an explicit zone in SQL/Python. Storage in local time is also wrong — it can't be migrated across a DST boundary without loss.

- **No marker before a copy-paste command block.** Nico's terminal renders markdown bullets (`-`, `*`, `•`) as `●`, which breaks paste into zsh. The line directly above a fenced command block must be a plain-text label ending in a colon — never a bullet, dash, asterisk, or number. For loud copy targets, lead the label with `📋` + bold `COPY THE BELOW`, then a colon, then the block.
