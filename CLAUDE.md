# CLAUDE.md

Session-by-session history lives in [docs/devlog.md](docs/devlog.md). This file carries only the latest session, project intent, and conventions.

## Session 2026-08-24 (laptop — NOT_FOUND self-heal SHIPPED via full SDD; iOS build 2 uploaded; iPhone smoke in progress at handoff)

Plan-reviewed then executed the NOT_FOUND fix end-to-end with subagent-driven development
(4 tasks, per-task + whole-branch reviews; plan at
`docs/plans/2026-08-23-not-found-self-heal-plan.md`). PR #92 merged, 1791 unit tests green
(1780 baseline + 11 new).

- **`resolveUnknownItem`** (`CloudRecordExchange`/`SyncRecordExchange`): a save failing
  `CKError.unknownItem` drops that record's archived system fields + upload-ledger entry
  so the next build is a fresh CREATE; returns whether there was state to drop.
- **`SaveFailureDisposition`** (pure, tested) + rewritten
  `CloudKitEngineControl.handleFailedSaves`: `.unknownItem` heals and re-enqueues
  **immediately** (no relaunch) — but only when archived state existed, so a dangling
  child reference cannot retry-loop; `.batchRequestFailed` siblings re-enqueue untouched;
  `.zoneNotFound` deliberately stays dropped (zone re-saved every start). The iPhone's
  stuck entries converge in two pushes.
- **`entryCanBePushed`** guard on all four child builders — no child ever ships a
  `CKRecord.Reference` to an Entry that is neither on the server nor buildable in-batch.
  One `SyncRevisionTests` fixture had encoded an unreachable state (revision push on a
  never-finalized capture) and now finalizes its capture.
- **Corrected semantics (final review caught a plan defect):** a recreate after a
  cross-device delete is *permanent* — CloudKit fetches deliver current state; no
  tombstone re-arrives. Resurrection is the documented bias (audio is ground truth);
  the `resolveUnknownItem` doc comment states what really happens.
- `CFBundleVersion` → 2; **iOS build 2 uploaded and SMOKE-VERIFIED on the iPhone**: the
  poisoned journal logged exactly one `unknown to the server — archived system fields
  dropped, next push is a create`, re-pushed as a CREATE, and appeared on the iPad with
  its cover photo. No repeat failure, no batch casualties. **The fix works.**
  Smoke technique that finally worked (Console.app streaming was fiddly): Nico runs
  `sudo /usr/bin/log collect --device-name "Nico's iPhone 17 pro" --last 10m --output
  /tmp/x.logarchive && sudo chmod -R a+rX /tmp/x.logarchive`, then the agent reads it with
  `/usr/bin/log show <archive> --predicate 'subsystem == "org.pianohouseproject.raconte"'
  --info --debug --style compact`. Captures history, agent-verifiable. (First smoke pass
  "failed" because the phone was still on build 1 — check the installed build in the
  TestFlight app before trusting a smoke.)
- **NEW BUG unmasked by the heal (investigation launched, report pending at handoff):**
  the iPad received ONLY the journal — **all 20 real entries (ULID-dated 2026-08-07 →
  08-16, the dev-build corpus) are re-enqueued every launch and refused** with
  `not finalized — push refused` from the record builders (`loadFinalizedManifest`/
  `isFinalized` reading nil/unverified), plus `revision <id> not found locally to push`.
  They play fine locally — data safe, but they never reach the server. This was masked
  yesterday: the diagnosis assumed entries were healthy and merely aborted by the
  journal's batch; the build-1 logs show the same refusals, so they were never buildable.
  Open questions for the investigator (Explore agent, report → next session): why does
  something re-enqueue them every launch if the scanner also refuses them (scanner/builder
  manifest-decode parity? restored engine-state pending changes?); did the Manifest schema
  gain non-optional fields after Aug 16 that old manifest.json files fail to decode; or do
  these manifests genuinely lack `final.verifiedAt` (verify step postdating the
  recordings) — and if so, what retroactive verify/migration is safe. Decisive experiment
  HANDED TO NICO, result unknown at handoff: record a NEW entry on the phone — if it
  syncs to the iPad, the pipeline is healthy and the bug is confined to the 20 old
  captures.
- Expected log noise, not failures: one expired-change-token retry on first fetch; the
  untouched dev-synced archive not migrating is #90 (ledger says "uploaded").
- **PR #93 open (merge after smoke):** `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false` in
  Info.plist so ASC stops asking the export-compliance question — recipe live-confirmed
  with the MusicForge session; effective from build 3's archive. This handoff's doc
  commit rides on that branch.
- Issues filed: **#89** (no sync-status UI in Release builds), **#90** (environment-tag
  `sync/` bookkeeping — system fields AND ledger AND engine-state; the only path that
  migrates the untouched dev archive), **#91** (child NOT_FOUND with no archived state
  waits for a launch-only reconcile on iOS).

**Next steps:**
1. **Root-cause the 20 refused entries** (new bug above): read the Explore agent's report
   (or re-run the investigation — its questions are listed above), fold in Nico's
   new-entry experiment result, then fix. Highest priority — the real corpus still
   doesn't sync.
2. Merge PR #93 (export compliance + this handoff's docs).
3. **macOS TestFlight**: `Raconte-macos-tf1.xcarchive` predates the fix — rebuild from
   merged main, then Nico runs `python3 scripts/asc_regenerate_profile.py --platform
   macos` and the export/upload it prints. Hold until item 1 is understood.
4. #90 (env-tag sync bookkeeping) when sync work resumes; #89 (About page w/ version +
   sync status — would have saved this whole smoke session) / #91 alongside.
5. **Sonnet batch:** #85, #83, #86, plus backlog #73–78.
6. Nico's calls: #81, #67 (10 items), #70, #68, #66, #63, #60/#59.

## What Raconte is

Native SwiftUI universal app (iOS 26 + macOS 26) for private, single-user spoken-word
journaling. Full rebuild of the frozen web app at github.com/nicolovejoy/recountly
(recountly.org). **Audio is ground truth; the transcript is a derived, replaceable
interpretation** — that principle drives every design choice.

Plan of record: `docs/native-rebuild-plan.md` (architecture, milestones, migration,
web teardown). Detailed designs in `docs/plans/`:
- `2026-07-29-m1-capture-design.md` — Milestone 1: indestructible capture (segment
  format, state machine, recovery scan, task breakdown)
- `2026-07-29-data-model-and-migration.md` — GRDB schema, CloudKit mapping, export
  package spec, Neon migration
- `2026-07-29-apple-sdk-recon.md` — SDK availability verified against installed Xcode

Milestone 1 smoke doc: `docs/m1-paranoid-tests.md` (full iPhone pass + iPad and macOS
delta passes, 32 tests total).

## Identity

- App name: **Raconte** (French, "tell!" — English *recount* comes from *raconter*)
- Bundle id: `org.pianohouseproject.raconte` (CloudKit container later:
  `iCloud.org.pianohouseproject.raconte`). `pianohouseproject.org` is the owner's
  public-facing namespace for all his work — publisher, not product. Changed 2026-07-31
  from `org.recountly.raconte`, which was product-under-product; nothing had shipped.
- Repo: github.com/nicolovejoy/raconte
- Single user (the owner). No accounts, no server. iCloud identity only (Milestone 4).

## Stack

- SwiftUI multiplatform target (NOT Catalyst), Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- Capture: AVAudioSession (iOS) / AVAudioEngine tap, append-only PCM segments on disk.
- Transcription (M2): on-device SpeechAnalyzer/SpeechTranscriber (iOS 26 API).
- Storage (M3): GRDB/SQLite + FTS5. Files in the app container.
- Sync (M4): CKSyncEngine → CloudKit private DB, custom zone.
- Xcode project is GENERATED — `project.yml` (XcodeGen) is the source of truth;
  `*.xcodeproj` is gitignored. After clone or project.yml edit: `xcodegen generate`.

## Commands

- `xcodegen generate` — (re)create Raconte.xcodeproj from project.yml

**Signing changed with M4 (2026-08-17) — the old bare macOS commands no longer work.**
The app now carries `com.apple.developer.icloud-*` entitlements, which are *restricted*:
macOS refuses to ad-hoc-sign a binary that has them (`"Raconte" has entitlements that
require signing with a development certificate`). Two macOS recipes, and it matters which:

Test (macOS) — ad-hoc signs against `Raconte-nocloud.entitlements`, the shipping list
minus the three sync keys. **Keeps the sandbox, which is not optional**: `RaconteTests`
runs with the real app as its test host, so an unsandboxed run makes `AppContainer.root()`
the owner's real `~/Library/Application Support/Raconte` rather than a container — the
launching app would scan and sweep his actual archive. Never `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`
here. (`EntitlementsParityTests` pins the override against the generated file, so adding
a capability to project.yml and forgetting the override fails loudly.)

📋 **COPY THE BELOW**:

```
xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
  CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS=Raconte/Raconte-nocloud.entitlements test
```

Owner-smoke app build (macOS) — real automatic signing, so the app actually carries the
iCloud entitlement. **This is the only macOS build that can sync.** An app built with the
nocloud override launches and behaves normally but `SyncCoordinator.live()` returns nil
(it reads the signature's entitlement), so a sync smoke against it silently tests
nothing. Needs the iCloud capability enabled on the App ID.

📋 **COPY THE BELOW**:

```
xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/raconte-smoke -allowProvisioningUpdates build
```

Hand the result over with `ditto`, never bare `cp -R`, and verify identity with
`dwarfdump --uuid` on `Raconte.debug.dylib` — see the DerivedData/stale-build traps above.

- iOS compile check: `xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme Raconte -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build`
- iOS simulator: `-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'` (check `xcrun simctl list devices` for available names). Simulator builds need **no** entitlements override — they don't validate restricted entitlements against a profile.
- UI tests (simulator only — macOS needs interactive automation permission):
  `xcodebuild -project Raconte.xcodeproj -scheme RaconteUI -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' test`

## Working style

- Plan → implement → review via subagents, one milestone task at a time (task breakdown
  lives in the M1 design doc). Test-first for the pure core (state machine, recovery
  planner, segment math) — hardware behind protocols.
- Docs: plain and terse. No grandiose prose.
- Signing: team `8UK463WB83` (in project.yml) is a **paid** Apple
  Developer Program membership — the same team MusicForge ships under. Nothing is gated on
  enrollment: TestFlight, CloudKit containers, push and Live Activities are all available
  now. (Verified 2026-07-31 from the on-disk profiles: App Store distribution profiles and
  year-long expiries, neither of which a free personal team can produce.)
- **UI tests reach places through `openPlace(app, "sidebar.…")` in
  `RaconteUITests/UITestNavigation.swift`.** Never hard-code a navigation tap in a test
  class — `openPlace` already handles the iPhone-collapsed-vs-Mac/iPad-both-columns
  difference (back-button vs. straight tap) in one place.
- **Nothing that must happen while a capture is running may hang off a view's
  lifecycle.** `CaptureView` is no longer permanently mounted (nav redesign) — it can
  be navigated away from at any time. Anything that must keep working regardless
  (phase dispatch, the idle-timer hold, receipt reconciliation) lives on
  `CaptureScreenModel` itself, driven by the model's own observation of its state,
  never by `.onAppear`/`.onDisappear`/`.onChange` on a view.
- **`ContentView.swift` is rewritten by both `nav/split-view` and `m4/sync`** and the
  two will conflict on merge — expected and accepted (nav design §10); whichever
  branch merges second resolves the conflict by hand.
- **Never put an `Image` in a macOS `Menu` label.** On macOS a `Menu`'s label discards
  SwiftUI's sizing of a resizable `Image` and paints it at intrinsic size — a 768×1024
  cover photo laid out at 768×1024 *points*, covering the whole screen and pushing the
  rest of the label off-window (#69). Proven by a six-variant harness: no in-place
  clamp and no `.menuStyle` fixes it — the image has to leave the label entirely. A
  `Button` label is fine; the image only breaks inside a `Menu`.
- **A `JournalSpan`/date-range endpoint is a unit, not an instant.** `PartialDate` is
  `Comparable` by `anchorDate`, which fills absent components with the FIRST — "2001"
  anchors to 1 Jan 2001. A naive `start <= d && d <= end` comparison against raw
  `PartialDate`s therefore excludes most of the range it claims to cover. Expand each
  endpoint to its precision's unit before comparing: `start` to the earliest instant of
  its unit, `end` to an EXCLUSIVE upper bound (the first instant of the unit right after
  `end`'s), and test `date >= lowerBound && date < exclusiveUpperBound`. Subtracting a
  fixed second to fake an inclusive bound under-covers the final second of the unit —
  build the exclusive bound from `calendar.dateInterval(of:for:).end` untouched instead.
- **An offscreen `Form` `Section` FOOTER is absent from the accessibility tree until it is
  scrolled into view** — so a UI test asserting on an explanatory footnote below the fold
  finds nothing and fails for the wrong reason. Reveal it with a directional `swipeUp()`
  before querying (a directional scroll, not a fixed distance, so it survives other device
  sizes). Discovered 2026-08-21 on the journal editor's disabled-delete footnote.
- **The `RaconteUI` suite exceeds the Bash tool's HARD 10-minute cap** (600000 ms is the
  maximum the tool accepts), so a single whole-suite invocation is killed mid-run and reads
  exactly like a hang. Split it into two or more FOREGROUND `-only-testing:` invocations by
  test class and reconcile the counts against the baseline. Do **not** background it — a
  subagent never receives the completion notification, which is the single most common
  stall on this project (11 instances). The unit suite still fits inside the cap.
- **A `.sheet` attached to a `Form`'s `Section` silently never presents, on iOS 26** —
  observed, mechanism unconfirmed. Attach `.sheet`/`.fullScreenCover` to the screen's
  outer view (the `Form` itself, or above it), never to a `Section` or other child.
- **`.tap()` on a `Toggle` inside a `Form`/`List` hits the row's merged label+switch
  accessibility frame at its CENTRE, which for a full-width row is the label, not the
  switch — the tap silently never flips it.** Real finger taps work fine; this is an
  XCUITest-harness gap. Tap near the trailing edge instead, e.g.
  `coordinate(withNormalizedOffset: CGVector(dx: 0.92, dy: 0.5))` — re-tune the offset
  per row width if a wider layout (iPad) is ever covered.
- **A pushed screen that can be popped without warning must write through on commit,
  never hold a Done-button-shaped batch of unsaved edits.**
  `PlaceRouting.detailPath(afterSelecting:from:path:)` always returns `[]`, so any
  sidebar click (and on the Mac, ⌘1-4) pops the top of `detailPath` with zero chance for
  that screen to intervene. The pattern (`JournalEditorView`, matching `BackdateField`):
  commit each field twice, redundantly — on losing focus (the ordinary case), and again
  in `onDisappear` via an **unstructured `Task {}`, never `.task`** (SwiftUI cancels
  `.task` on disappear, defeating the whole point of the safety net).

**UI design rules (owner, 2026-08-02):**
- The capture screen pins a near-black background; any system control placed on it must
  pin `.environment(\.colorScheme, .dark)` — ambient-scheme bubbles render dark-on-dark
  in light mode (bit us once).
- Prefer semantic colors over `Color(white:)` literals anywhere the background isn't
  pinned.
- Backdates are sticky: editable with explicit overrides, never clearable by one tap.
  Owner wants metadata edits auditable eventually (fold into T6 revision design).

## Shared conventions

<!-- These are Nico's cross-repo output rules. They're materialized into each repo's
CLAUDE.md so every agent (local, cloud, third-party) sees them as plain text. Source
of truth: prompt-lab/workflow/claude-md-shared.md — edit there and re-sync, never here. -->

- **Clickable URLs.** When pointing at any web destination (dashboard, repo, PR, deploy, settings, docs, localhost), print the full bare URL — `https://example.com` or `http://localhost:8080` — on its own, never just the page's name and never a markdown `[label](url)` link. Nico's terminal auto-linkifies raw `https://` text, so a bare URL is one-click and stays copyable.

- **Number your questions.** Any time you ask Nico more than one question, present them as a numbered list (1., 2., 3.) so he can answer by number with no ambiguity. A single standalone question needs no number.

- **Self-contained smoke-test instructions.** When you ask Nico to manually test or verify an app or website, assume zero carried-over context — he should never scroll back or recall a URL/path/credential from earlier. Always include: the exact URL (full `https://…` or `http://localhost:…`, restated even if mentioned above), the precise steps in order, and what a pass vs. fail looks like. Repetition here is a feature, not clutter.

- **UTC at rest, Pacific on display.** Timestamps are stored in UTC, always. A *calendar day* shown to a human is `America/Los_Angeles` — Nico's day, and the clock the work actually happened on. The two rules that follow are the ones that get broken: never form a date bucket with `new Date(…).toISOString().slice(0,10)` (that is UTC, so every chart axis and "today" silently rolls over at 5pm Pacific — it put a phantom tomorrow bar on the Prompt Lab dashboard), and never bucket UTC-stamped rows with a bare `date(col)` in SQL. Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-CA', { timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles' })` in JS and an explicit zone in SQL/Python. Storage in local time is also wrong — it can't be migrated across a DST boundary without loss.

- **No marker before a copy-paste command block.** Nico's terminal renders markdown bullets (`-`, `*`, `•`) as `●`, which breaks paste into zsh. The line directly above a fenced command block must be a plain-text label ending in a colon — never a bullet, dash, asterisk, or number. For loud copy targets, lead the label with `📋` + bold `COPY THE BELOW`, then a colon, then the block.
